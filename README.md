Geeky Ghost Designs - Image/Video Processing Tool
=================================================

Description:
------------
This Image/Video Processing Tool allows you to extract frames from an MP4 video file and convert a sequence of image files (JPG or PNG) back into a video file. This is useful for video editing, analysis, or other creative projects.

Installation:
-------------
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the script and place it in a folder along with the "run.bat" file.
3. Download the "requirements.txt" file and place it in the same folder as the script and "run.bat" file.

How to use:
-----------
1. Double-click the "run.bat" file to start the tool.
2. The tool will set up a virtual environment, install necessary packages, and launch the Image/Video Processing Tool.
3. Use the "Browse" button to select the folder containing the image files (JPG or PNG) or the MP4 video file you want to process.
4. Use the "Save As" button to choose a name and location for the output video file.
5. Enter the desired frames per second (FPS) for the output video.
6. Click "Concatenate" to convert the image sequence to a video file, or click "Extractinator" to extract frames from the selected MP4 video file.
7. The tool will save the output file in the specified location or create a new folder for extracted frames.

Important notes:
----------------
- Make sure you run the "run.bat" file instead of running the script directly. The "run.bat" file ensures that the necessary Python packages are installed in a virtual environment.
- The tool will create an "output" folder in the same directory as the script to store project folders for extracted frames. Each project folder is named "projectXXX", where "XXX" is a unique 3-digit number.
