Geeky Ghost Designs Image to Video Converter

This script allows you to convert a folder of images into a video with ease. The script uses the MoviePy library to create the video from the images.

Requirements:

Python 3
MoviePy library
How to Install:

Clone the repository or download the files to your computer.
Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the folder containing the files.
Create a virtual environment by running the command "python -m venv venv".
Activate the virtual environment by running "venv\Scripts\activate" on Windows or "source venv/bin/activate" on Linux/MacOS.
Install the necessary requirements by running "pip install -r requirements.txt".
How to Use:

Double click the "run.bat" file to launch the Image to Video Converter.
Click the "Browse" button to select the folder containing the images you want to convert.
Choose a name and location for the output video by clicking the "Save As" button.
Select a frame rate for the video by entering a number in the "FPS" field.
Click the "Convert" button to create the video.
Notes:

The Image to Video Converter currently only supports .jpg and .png image formats.
The output video will be saved in .mp4 format.
The output video will have the same resolution as the input images.

note: All images must be the same resolution. WIP, not responsible or liable and all that jazz. Simple script in python with tinker UI. 

note 2: You can modify the run.bat file how you like, I'm just forgetful and lazy. This just makes it easy on me lol. 


Made with assistance from ChatGPT. Primarily for tikerUI. Script is one I wrote and have been using for awhile by just dragging and dropping the images into the folder that was the scripts home. Now that I can do a bit more than just single scripts, wanted to make this a full thing. Slowly expanding it with the help of chatGPT. Original terrible idea and execution that worked? Mine! GUI and new features coming, probably mostly GPT lol.
