Title: Image/Video Processing Tool
Version: 1.0
Date: 2023-03-27

Description
This is a Python script that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to process images and create videos. It allows users to concatenate a sequence of images into a video, extract frames from a video file, and synchronize the resulting video with an audio file. This tool can be used for various content creation and AI generation purposes, including the creation of 2D style animations.

How It Works
The script utilizes the following Python libraries:

OpenCV (cv2)
LibROSA
Tkinter
NumPy
MoviePy
Aubio
The GUI allows users to:

Browse and select image, video, and audio files.
Set the desired frames per second (FPS) for the output video.
Perform the following actions:
Concatenate: Creates a video by concatenating a sequence of images.
Extractenator: Extracts frames from a video file and saves them as individual images.
Users can also create a video where images are displayed according to the rhythm of an audio file. The script uses the LibROSA library to extract the onset times of audio events and then synchronizes the images accordingly.

How to Use
To use this script, ensure that you have Python and the required libraries installed on your system. Then, run the script, and the GUI will appear. Follow these steps to create your desired output:

For concatenating images into a video:

Browse and select the folder containing the images you want to use.
(Optional) Browse and select an audio file to synchronize with the video.
Set the desired FPS for the output video.
Click the "Concatenate" button.
For extracting frames from a video:

Browse and select the video file you want to extract frames from.
Click the "Extractenator" button.
For creating a video with images displayed according to the rhythm of an audio file:

Browse and select the folder containing the images you want to use.
Browse and select an audio file to synchronize with the video.
Set the desired FPS for the output video.
Click the "Concatenate" button.
Potential for 2D Style Animation Process
This tool can be employed in a 2D style animation process by providing a sequence of hand-drawn or digitally generated images as input. The script will then concatenate these images into a video. By synchronizing the video with an audio file, users can create an animation that follows the rhythm of the audio track. This allows for the production of dynamic, engaging 2D animations with minimal effort.
